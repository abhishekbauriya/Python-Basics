## Getting Ready with Python

### Installing Python 3, And Launching Jupyter Notebook or Command Prompt

Installing Python is really a cakewalk. Search for "Python download" on www.google.com. Download the installable and install it.

A quick word of caution on Windows
- Make sure that you have the check-box "Add Python 3.6 to PATH", checked. 

Once you have installed Python, you can launch the Python Shell. 
- Windows - Launch cmd prompt by typing in 'cmd' command. 
- Mac or Linux - Launch up terminal. 

Command to launch Python 3 is different in Mac.
- In Mac, type in `python3`
- In other operating systems, including windows, type `python`

You can type code in python shell and code as well in Jupyter Notebook. 

- Just enter command jupyter notebook to began using it.

You can use ```print(5*4)```, and it shows ```20```. 

You can execute the code, and the jupyter would immediately give you output.

Using the the Jupyter Notebook is an awesome way to learn Python.
